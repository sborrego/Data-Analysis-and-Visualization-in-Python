# Data Visualization in Python
University of South Florida workshop   
Wednesday, March 2nd, 2022  
10:00 - 11:30 am EST  

This workshop will introduce the powerful Python data visualization library Matplotlib. We will create visualizations for different kinds of data and explore how to customize and share these visualizations. This  is a follow-up workshop to the *Introduction to Python* workshop, you can find the material [HERE](https://github.com/sborrego/Introduction-to-Python/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Python.ipynb).

## Software Installation

We will program in Python using JupyterLab, a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date web browser -- Chrome, Safari and Firefox are all supported.

To start the software, you will also need to find the command line (aka terminal, shell) on your system. If you are not familiar with the command line on your system, you can find help [HERE](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html#where-to-type-commands-how-to-open-a-new-shell).

### <u>Recommended Installation - Anaconda</u>

Downloading Python and JupyterLab independently may often times run into issues that are tricky and time consuming to resolve. A simpler method of installing is to use the all-in-one installer Anaconda. It provides a user-friendly interface, allows easy access to Python packages, and is simple to install.

Download Anaconda - [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)  
Addition Help with Anaconda - [HERE](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup.html#installing-python-using-anaconda)

If you are familiar with your command line and prefer to install Python and JupyterLab individually, you can find the links and installation instructions on the software websites below.

### Python

There are two current versions of Python -- we will be using version 3.5 or later. 

Download Python 3.x - [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### JupyterLab

Install JupyterLab by following the first set of instructions - [https://jupyter.org/jnstall](https://jupyter.org/install)
